eu quero fazer um modelo que diz bom, medio bom, medio mau, mau.

nao tenho targetVariable por isso uso unsupervised learning.

posso usar clustering ou association. 

association talvez fosse util para perceber correlaçoes entre timestamp e velocidade/fluxo. 
clustering podia classificar em clusters diretamente o transito bom ou mau. aprofundar tambem time series clustering

escolher algoritmos dos dois e depois testar para ver a sua performance

algoritmos clustering (sem time series):
  x - Affinity Propagation - estimates the number of clusters
    - Agglomerative Clustering - most common type of hierarchical clustering used to group objects in clusters based on their similarity
  x - BIRCH - uses a hierarchical approach to cluster large datasets by first building a tree-like structure of subclusters and then grouping them into larger clusters
  x - DBSCAN - given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away)
    - K-Means - partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid)
  x - Mini-Batch K-Means
    - Mean Shift -  This algorithm moves the centers of the clusters to the maximum density of data points, allowing it to identify clusters of arbitrary shape and size.
    - OPTICS - Its basic idea is similar to DBSCAN, but it addresses one of DBSCAN's major weaknesses: the problem of detecting meaningful clusters in data of varying density.
  x - Spectral Clustering -  transforms the data into a low-dimensional space and then uses K-means or another clustering algorithm to group them into clusters.
    - Mixture of Gaussians - probabilistic models and use the soft clustering approach for distributing the points in different clusters.

algoritmos de clustering (com time series):
    - Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) - measures the similarity between two time series by finding the optimal alignment between them
    - K-means clustering with Dynamic Time Warping (K-means+DTW) - variant of K-means that uses DTW as a distance metric to cluster time series data.
  x - Time Series Shapelets - identifies characteristic subseries (shapelets) that can distinguish different classes
    - Hierarchical Time Series Clustering - in agglomerative hierarchical clustering, you start out with every data point as its own cluster and then, with each step, the algorithm merges the two “closest” points until a set number of clusters, k, is reached
  x - Time Series Classification and Clustering based on SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) - transforms the time series into a symbolic representation using discretization
    - Time Series Motif Discovery - repeated subsequences found within a longer time series

algoritmos association (sem time series):
  x - Apriori algorithm - main goal is to create the association rule between different objects
    - FP-Growth algorithm - alternative way to find frequent item sets without using candidate generations
  x - Association Rule Hiding - modifies the dataset to prevent sensitive association rules from being discovered while preserving other interesting rules
  x - Collaborative Filtering - technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users
    - Sequential Pattern Mining - mining of frequently appearing series events or subsequences as patterns
  x - Markov Models - models the probability of a sequence of events using a stochastic process and uses it to make predictions about future events
  x - Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) - maps high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional grid while preserving their topological properties.

algoritmos association (com time series):
  x - Time series Apriori - extends the Apriori algorithm to handle time series data by considering patterns of time series subsequences
    - Episode Discovery - identifies frequently occurring episodes (patterns of events that occur in a specific order)
  x - Temporal Association Rule Mining - identifies association rules that involve time intervals in addition to itemsets
  x - Time-Delayed Association Rule Mining -  identifies association rules that involve time delays between events
  x - Time Series Clustering - groups together similar time series based on their shape or other features
    - Temporal Sequence Mining - identifies frequent subsequences and patterns of events that occur over time
